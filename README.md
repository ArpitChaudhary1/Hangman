# ðŸŽ¯ Hangman Game (Python)

Welcome to the **Hangman Game**, a classic word-guessing game built using Python!  
This is a beginner-level console game where the player attempts to guess a randomly selected word one letter at a time before exhausting their lives.



## ðŸš€ About the Project

I am in the learning phase of Python, and I created this basic game to enhance my skills in Python.  
The game reads from a large word list and provides an engaging experience using simple ASCII art to represent each stage of the game.  
It was a great way for me to apply concepts like file handling, loops, conditionals, and list manipulation in Python.
